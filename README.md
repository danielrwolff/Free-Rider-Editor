# Free-Rider-Editor
This is a project I decided to work on for fun at the end of high school (2015) - written in Java/Processing.
It's my own version of the track editor found in the actual game. You can play the game here: http://www.freeriderhd.com/

Features include:
  - Import and export to and from the actual Free Rider HD editor.
  - Edit lines (both physical and sceneric) with line and eraser tool.
  - Add powerups (powerups not labelled - not recommended).

Currently the project is on hold due to university taking up most of my time. 

Possible future updates:
  - Add individual icons to each of the powerups.
  - Find a way to properly add the gravity and boost (arrow) powerups.
  - Add the curved line tool.
  - Possibly add the biker.

Libraries used:
